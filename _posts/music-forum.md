Before my journey into code and development, my undying passion was music. I was signed to a developmental deal in Nashville, TN at 18 and toured 42 states, performing over 50 live shows in just 3 months.

Obsessed with the creative process, I firmly believed that four simple chords could yield infinite possibilities. This belief steered me away from touring and into the world of songwriting. Since then, I've accumulated millions of Spotify streams and have written for numerous artists and labels, ultimately securing a publishing deal with a London-based writing house.

Over a decade later, my passion for creativity remains unwavering, but my chosen outlet has shifted to software development. For years, I've pondered how to combine my love for software with my music industry experience. However, one persistent obstacle I encountered in the music race was the pervasive "pay-to-play" culture. As a broke musician, I invested every penny I had into equipment, producers, and audio engineers. Yet, even after pouring my heart and soul into crafting a song, I was disheartened to discover that exposing it to an audience required payment, whether overt or hidden.

Getting on Spotify playlists necessitated payment to the playlist owners, while securing exposure on Soundcloud meant purchasing premium ad space. The same applied to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Noisetrade—the price of breaking through the noise was always financial. Ironically, these music "communities" positioned themselves as advocates for musicians while perpetuating this disparity between the business and art of music. I aspire to rectify this issue through software.

My solution to this predicament is the Underpaid Gazelle music forum—a genuine music community that delivers on the promises made by other businesses. I aim to create a community where every musician can freely share and support music without algorithms or paywalls impeding their success. As a musician, your journey begins by creating a simple profile and uploading your music.

Once done, you become a listener, actively seeking out other musicians and cultivating a network. If you wish to gain exposure, you must reciprocate by supporting others. Imagine a door-to-door mentality, but in the digital realm. If your music is exceptional, your followers can share it across their feeds, exponentially increasing your exposure rate. The ultimate objective here is grassroots growth—no payments to boost your song's visibility. If your talent shines, and your network expands, organic rewards will follow, representing the optimal path to building a music career.

I'm going a bit "latte dev" on this due to time constraints and the desire to ship quickly and often. Because of this my tech stack includes:
- Supabase
- Next.js
- Vercel for delivery and deployment
